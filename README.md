Grid<Object> holds the 'pieces' ( = new OriginRangeGrid<Object>(1,1) //assuming 1x1 grid
The Grid is like a 2 dimensional array.

then pieces.put(new Creature(), Space.get(0,0)); Space might have some power over this Grid and handles filling

GridPane is what displays the Grid that was created, as GridPane extends(?) JComponent
GridPane grid = new GridPane(pieces);
add(grid);
pack();
